EasyCheat UI v1.1
------------------
Easily add a cheat menu to your game with EasyCheat UI! Easily connect cheat functions in scripts to a clickable button or toggleable toggle; no more typing secret codes to execute cheats just because you didn't want to take the time to make a pretty menu.

Adding new buttons and toggles is easy. Just add the prefab into the UI's heirarchy, adjust it's position and label (a child in the prefab), and connect it to the scripted function(s) you want to call.
